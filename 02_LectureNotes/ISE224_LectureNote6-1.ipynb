This is because the data, stored in RAM and referenced by variables, vanishes once the program ceases to operate. To preserve data across multiple instances of the program, a method for saving it is required. By saving data in a `file`, typically located on a computer's disk, it remains accessible even after the program halts. This stored data can then be fetched and utilized at a later point in time."

When a piece of data is written to a file, it is ***copied from a variable in RAM to the file***. This is illustrated in the following figure. The term output file is used to describe a file that data is written to. It is called an `output file` because the program stores `output` in it.\n",

If you want to read a piece of data that is stored at the very end of the file, you have to read all of the data that comes before it—you cannot jump directly to the desired data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direct Access:** When you work with a direct access file (which is also known as a random access file), you can jump directly to any piece of data in the file without reading the data that comes before it. This is similar to the way a CD player or an MP3 player works. You can jump directly to any song that you want to listen to.  \n",

For example, when you create a document with a word processor and save the document in a file, you have to specify a filename. When you use a utility such as Windows Explorer to examine the contents of your disk, you see a list of filenames.

For example, the files depicted in the prior figure have the extensions `.jpg`,`.txt`, and`.doc`. The extension usually indicates the type of data stored in the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, the `.jpg` extension usually indicates that the file contains a graphic image that is compressed according to the JPEG image standard. \n",
