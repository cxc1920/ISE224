    "\n",
    "2. **Convert Each Byte to Decimal**: Each byte represents a decimal number. Convert it using the binary to decimal conversion method where each bit represents a power of 2, starting from the right (least significant bit). For example, the binary `01000001` converts to decimal as follows:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - $(0 \\times 2^7) + (1 \\times 2^6) + (0 \\times 2^5) + (0 \\times 2^4) + (0 \\times 2^3) + (0 \\times 2^2) + (0 \\times 2^1) + (1 \\times 2^0)$\n",

It represents text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices that use text. Developed in the early 1960s, ASCII originally based its design on the English alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about ASCII include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Representation**: ASCII uses a `7-bit` binary number to represent each character. This allows for `128` possible characters (0 to 127 in decimal).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Characters Included**: The standard includes control characters (like carriage return, tab, etc.), punctuation marks, digits (0-9), uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), and some special symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extended ASCII**: Due to the limitations of only 128 characters, extended versions of ASCII (using `8` bits instead of 7, allowing `256` possible characters) have been developed to include additional symbols, foreign characters, and graphical symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Significance**: ASCII played a vital role in the development of modern computing and the Internet. It established a standard that allowed different machines and systems to communicate textually.\n",

    "\n",
    "Two's complement is a mathematical operation on binary numbers, widely used in computer systems for representing signed integers. Here's a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MSB & LSB**: The leftmost digit is the most significant bit (MSB), and the rightmost is the least significant bit (LSB).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Signed Numbers**: To represent negative numbers, one common method is using the MSB as the sign bit: 0 for positive, 1 for negative. However, this leads to two representations of zero (+0 and -0) and complicates arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Two's Complement Representation**: Two's complement solves these issues. In this system, positive numbers are represented as usual, but negative numbers are represented differently:\n",
    "- To find the two's complement of a binary number, invert all the bits (change 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s) – this is the one's complement.\n",
    "- Then, add 1 to the resulting number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- The two's complement of `00000101` (5 in decimal) is `11111011` (-5 in decimal).\n",
    "- To convert `11111011` back to a positive number, apply the two's complement process again: invert to `00000100`, then add 1 to get `00000101` (5 in decimal).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- Simplifies arithmetic operations: Addition and subtraction can be performed uniformly without considering the sign of the operands.\n",
    "- Only one zero representation, eliminating the ambiguity of +0 and -0.\n",
    "- The range of representable numbers in n bits is from `-2^(n-1)` to `2^(n-1)-1`. For example, a 8-bit system can represent numbers from -128 to 127."

    "   - **Sign bit**: Indicates whether the number is positive or negative.\n",
    "   - **Exponent**: Used to represent the magnitude of the number.\n",
    "   - **Mantissa (or Significand)**: Represents the precision of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### * IEEE 754 Standard:\n",
    "   - **Single Precision (32-bit)**:\n",
    "     - 1 bit for the sign.\n",
    "     - 8 bits for the exponent.\n",
    "     - 23 bits for the mantissa.\n",
    "   - **Double Precision (64-bit)**:\n",
    "     - 1 bit for the sign.\n",
    "     - 11 bits for the exponent.\n",
    "     - 52 bits for the mantissa.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### * Format:\n",
    "   - A floating-point number is typically represented in a form like $(-1)^{sign} × 1.mantissa × 2^{exponent - bias}$.\n",
    "   - The **bias** is a fixed number used to adjust the range of the exponent. For IEEE 754 single precision, the bias is 127, and for double precision, it's 1023.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### * Example (Simplified):\n",
    "   - Consider a 32-bit floating-point number `01000000101000000000000000000000`.\n",
    "   - **Sign**: `0` (positive).\n",
    "   - **Exponent**: `10000001` (129 in decimal; actual exponent = 129 - 127 = 2).\n",
    "   - **Mantissa**: `01000000000000000000000` (representing the fractional part).\n",
    "   - This number would be interpreted as `1.01000000000000000000000` (binary) × 2^2, which converts to a decimal number.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### * Advantages and Limitations:\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Can represent very large or very small numbers, and handle fractional numbers.\n",
    "   - **Limitations**: Precision is limited; rounding errors can occur. Not every real number can be precisely represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, floating-point representation is a complex yet efficient way to store and manipulate real numbers in computing, balancing the need for range and precision against the limitations of finite memory."

    "**Example.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider representing the decimal number `-6.25` in IEEE 754 single precision format (32-bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determine the Sign**:\n",
    "   - Since `-6.25` is negative, the sign bit is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert the Absolute Value to Binary**:\n",
    "   - The absolute value is `6.25`. In binary, `6` is `110`, and `.25` (1/4) is `.01` (since `1/4` is the second fractional binary digit). So, `6.25` in binary is `110.01`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalize the Binary Number**:\n",
    "   - Write `110.01` in normalized form as `1.1001 × 2^2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Determine the Exponent**:\n",
    "   - The exponent is `2`. In IEEE 754, it's biased by adding `127`, so the biased exponent is `2 + 127 = 129`, which is `10000001` in binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Find the Mantissa**:\n",
    "   - The mantissa is the normalized value without the leading `1` and the binary point: `1001`. In IEEE 754, it's filled to 23 bits, so it becomes `10010000000000000000000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Combine the Components**:\n",
    "   - Sign bit: `1`\n",
    "   - Exponent: `10000001`\n",
    "   - Mantissa: `10010000000000000000000`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final IEEE 754 Representation:\n",
    "The complete 32-bit binary representation of `-6.25` is `11000000110010000000000000000000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This binary sequence represents the sign, exponent, and mantissa in the IEEE 754 single precision format for the given real number.\n"

    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A `program` is a set of `instructions` that tells a computer how to perform a task. `Programming` involves `writing these instruction`s in a language that the computer can understand, typically a programming language like Python, Java, or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Lifecycle of a Program\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Writing Code\n",
    "- **Development**: Programmers write code using a programming language. This code describes the `logic` and `operations` that the computer must perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Compiling Code (if necessary)\n",
    "- **Compilation**: For languages like C++ or Java, the written code (source code) must be `compiled`. This means converting it into `machine code` that the computer's CPU can understand.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Languages like Python are interpreted, meaning they are <u>read and executed by a program called an `interpreter`</u>, which translates the code into machine code `on the fly`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Loading into Memory\n",
    "- **Execution**: Before a program can run, it must be loaded into the computer's memory (RAM).\n",
    "- **Resources**: The operating system allocates the necessary resources and memory space for the program to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Execution by the CPU\n",
    "- **Processing**: The CPU executes the program's instructions one at a time, performing calculations, and logic operations as required.\n",
    "- **Input/Output**: The program interacts with other system components, like storage, network, and peripherals, to process input and produce output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Termination\n",
    "- **Completion**: Once all instructions have been executed, the program terminates.\n",
    "- **Cleanup**: The operating system reclaims any memory and resources that were allocated to the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are the essence of a computer's functionality. They turn complex tasks into a series of logical steps that the computer can follow, using its hardware and operating system to produce the desired outcomes.\n",

    "### High-Level vs Low-Level Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages are often categorized into high-level and low-level languages, each with its own characteristics and uses. Here's an overview to help understand the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>High-Level Programming Languages</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition\n",
    "- High-level programming languages are `closer to human languages` and `further from machine code`. They are abstracted from the details of the underlying hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Abstract**: They provide strong abstraction from the hardware.\n",
    "- **Easy to Understand**: Syntax and semantics are closer to human languages, making them easier to learn and use.\n",
    "- **Portable**: Code can often be run on different types of systems without modification.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, and Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "- **Productivity**: Faster development time due to simpler syntax and many built-in functions.\n",
    "- **Maintenance**: Easier to read, write, and maintain.\n",
    "- **Cross-platform Support**: Often designed to be platform-independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Written code is usually interpreted or compiled into machine code that the computer can execute. This process is handled by compilers or interpreters, translating high-level instructions into low-level commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Low-Level Programming Languages</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition\n",
    "- Low-level programming languages are `closer to the machine's instruction set architecture`. They provide `little or no abstraction` from a computer's microprocessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Machine-Oriented**: Code and syntax reflect the `machine's architecture` and `instruction set`.\n",
    "- **Efficient Execution**: Programs can be more efficient as they allow direct control over the hardware.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Assembly language, Machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "- **Performance**: Potential for higher performance applications because they can be optimized for the specific hardware.\n",
    "- **Control**: Greater control over system resources and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code written in a low-level language is often assembled into machine code directly with a one-to-one correspondence, which can then be executed by the computer's CPU without further translation."
