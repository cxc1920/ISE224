One of the critical components that get installed with Python is the Python interpreter. In this course, we are going to install `anaconda`, which is a open-source distribution of the `Python` and `R` programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the package management system.\n",
